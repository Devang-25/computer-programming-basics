## Introduction:

An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

For simplicity, we can think of an array a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (letâ€™s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on.
