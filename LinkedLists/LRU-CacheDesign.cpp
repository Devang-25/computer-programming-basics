/*
LRU Cache design algorithm
LRU -> Least Recently Used

This problem can also be done using Arrays but time complexity
will be higher. 
Given the fact that Cache is the fastest memory available, we look for a method which does not sacrifise speed.
Since the fastest ds available is Hash table we use it with doubly linked list
